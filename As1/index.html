        “I quickly came to understand that code is a superpower every young woman should be able to access. 
        Understanding that code is the underlying (and invisible) framework of tech means that we do not have to 
        be passive bystanders in our ever-changing digital world.”“I have been working in tech for 10 years now, and always had a feeling that I am missing the foundation of software development & computer science. If you know that feeling, this is the perfect course for you!
        You are not a full-stack software developer after the course, but you have built the foundation to become one, 
        or continue on a management path in tech, but with a huge confidence & knowledge boost.”
